## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do

## Write a short comment describing this function
## This function will make a "special" matrix, and can cache its inverse
## You can also take the original matrix back

                x <<- y

## Write a short comment describing this function
## This function will calculate the inverse of the matrix
## If the matrix was already passed and its inverse was calculated already
## You can get that inverse from the cache

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
        inv <- x$getinverse()
        if(!is.null(inv)) {
                message("getting cached data")
                return(inv)
        }
        data <- x$get()
        inv <- solve(data, ...)
        x$setinverse(inv)
        inv
